Hello everyone,

Today, I'd like to talk about a crucial topic in web security вЂ“ Cross-Site Scripting, commonly known as XSS. XSS is a type of vulnerability that can have serious consequences for web applications and their users. During this presentation, we'll explore what XSS is, how it works, its impact, and most importantly, how we can protect our applications from it.

Let's start by understanding what XSS is. XSS is a type of attack on web systems that involves injecting malicious code into web pages generated by the web application. This code is executed on the user's computer when they open the infected page, allowing it to interact with the attacker's web server.

There are different types of XSS attacks, including Stored XSS, Reflected XSS, and DOM-based XSS. Each type targets different vulnerabilities in web applications. For example, Stored XSS stores the malicious script in the application's database, whereas Reflected XSS reflects it back to the user via a URL or form input, whereas DOM-based XSS modifies the Document Object Module.

What does all this give to an attacker? The attacker, being able to use his malicious code, can get, for example, a user's cookie - this means that a hacker does not need to know the login and password from the system at all in order to be authorized on the sites that the user uses. Knowing the cookie, an attacker can substitute the value of the user instead of his value and enter the account as if he were the user, and further, with insufficient verification of the user's identification, the hacker will be able to perform all operations that only the user had access to before.

And also this example was DOM-based type because I know that newly created cars added to the DOM by innerHTML property. But if this data were stored in the database and were available to everyone, then this type of hack could be called stored XSS.

Now, let's dive into the impact of XSS attacks. The consequences can be severe, ranging from unauthorized access to personal data, defacement of websites, to financial loss and reputation damage for both users and organizations. In some cases, XSS can serve as a stepping stone for further attacks, leading to a chain of security breaches.

So, how can we defend against XSS attacks?

- First-of-all, do NOT use the вЂњinnerHTMLвЂќ property when you don't need it. As you saw in the example above, it results to DOM-based XSS. Use вЂњtextContentвЂќ instead.
- Always sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent any malicious code from being executed. For example, you can use the encodeURIComponent function on those places where there could be malicious code. But this is the maximum that you can do on the client side.
- The back-end developer must also ensure that no malicious information enters the database at the server level.
- Regarding validation: you can only allow certain characters to be entered.
- Use HTTPOnly when creating an HTTP cookie. It ensures that the cookie is only accessible through HTTP(S) requests and cannot be accessed by client-side scripts.

- Another critical defense is to implement the Content Security Policy (CSP). CSP is an added layer of security that helps detect and mitigate XSS attacks by specifying which sources of content are allowed to be loaded on a web page. It restricts the execution of scripts from unauthorized origins.
- Furthermore, keep your web applications and server software up-to-date. Security patches and updates are often released to address known vulnerabilities, including those related to XSS.

  Educating developers and users about XSS risks and best practices is essential. Awareness can go a long way in preventing security incidents. Regular security audits and penetration testing can also help identify potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited.

  In conclusion, Cross-Site Scripting is a significant threat to web applications and their users. As developers and security professionals, it is our responsibility to implement strong defenses against XSS attacks. By following best practices, conducting regular security assessments, and staying vigilant, we can ensure a safer online environment for everyone.

  Thank you for your attention, and I hope you found this presentation informative. Have a great day!
